        price: 49.00,
        image: "img/products/f1.jpg",

## 💻 Browser Console Tricks

```javascript
// Check if systems loaded
cartManager        // Should show object
shopProducts       // Should show array

// Add product manually
cartManager.addToCart(shopProducts[0], 1)

// View cart data
console.log(cartManager.cart)

// Check localStorage
console.log(localStorage.cart)

// Clear everything
localStorage.clear()
```
